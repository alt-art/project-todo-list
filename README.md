# Project To-Do list

In this project, I made a To-Do list app.

## Project requirements

### 1 - Add to your list the title 'My To-Do List' in a <header> tag

### 2 - Add below the title a small and unobtrusive paragraph with id='working' and with the text 'Double-click an item to mark it as complete'

### 3 - Add an input with id='task-text' where the user can type the name of the item they want to add to the list

### 4 - Add an ordered list of tasks with id='to-do list'

### 5 - Add a button with id='create-task' and, by clicking on this button, a new item should be created at the end of the list and the input text should be cleared

### 6 - Sort to-do list items in order of creation

### 7 - It must not be possible to select more than one element from the list at the same time

### 8 - Double-clicking on an item causes it to be crossed out, indicating that it has been completed. It should be possible to undo this action by double-clicking the item again

### 9 - Add a button with id='delete-everything' that when clicked should delete all items in the list

### 10 - Add a button with id='remove-finalized' that when clicked removes **only** the finalized elements from your list

### 11 - Add a button with id='save-tasks' that saves the contents of the list. If you close and reopen the page, the list should continue in the state it was in.

### 12 - Add two buttons, one with id='move-up' and one with id='move-down', which allow moving the selected item up or down in the task list

### 13 - Add a button with id='remove-selected' which, when clicked, removes the selected item
